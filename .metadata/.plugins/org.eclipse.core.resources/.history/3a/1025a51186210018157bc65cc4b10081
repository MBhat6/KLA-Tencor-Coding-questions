1. This program take a use inputs
	(in our case, we are testing the program with three inputs
	String 1 => "KLA-Tencor is a great company to work with"
	String 2 => "" Empty String
	String 3 => "0")

2. If the user input is null or empty, then the output received should be "INVALID - No string input to reverse"
3. If there a valid user input, then the program splits the string into array of strings
4. Then a for loop is used to run through half the length of array (mid-point) and it just replaces the first item of the array with the last item.
	Then goes to second iteration to replace the 2nd item of the array with last-but-one (arraySize - 2) item. And continues to repeat this until it reached the midpoint of the array. When the loop reached the midpoint, it will have replaced all the array items
5. It then return the string representation of this array (using substring to get the string).
